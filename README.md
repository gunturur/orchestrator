# orchestrator


1. Description:

The project will create an Orchestration System, which is a control system that can manage different types of workflows. Each workflow is made up of multiple sub-steps, and the system can track and control the execution of these steps in the correct order.

2. Problem Statement:

In day to dat network role, complex tasks need to be executed in a specific order. Manual tracking and managing of these tasks can be error-prone and inefficient. The orchestration system aims to automate this process, increasing efficiency and reducing errors.

3. Technical Components:

The technical components of the project will include:

   - Routes: The REST API will have endpoints to manage workflows and steps. These will allow the creation, retrieval, update, and deletion (CRUD operations) of workflows and steps.
   - Data Models: The data will be stored in MongoDB. Models will include `Workflow` (with fields like `name`, `description`, `steps`) and `Step` (with fields like `name`, `description`, `status`, `executionOrder`).
   - Workflow Engine: This is the core component that will execute the steps in the correct order and manage their status.

4. Meeting Project Requirements:

The project will meet requirements by building a REST API with Node.js and Express, using MongoDB as a database. The project will include error handling middleware for improved error responses.

5. Project Timeline:

- Week 1:
   - Setup the Node.js project with Express and MongoDB.
   - Design and create the data models (`Workflow`, `Step`).
   - Implement routes for creating (POST) and retrieving (GET) workflows and steps.
- Week 2:
   - Implement the routes for updating (PUT) and deleting (DELETE) workflows and steps.
   - Implement the Workflow Engine to execute the steps in the correct order and manage their status.
- Week 3:
   - Ensure all components are working together as expected.
   - Implement error handling middleware for better error response.
   - Refactor the code and fix any bugs.
   - Prepare the final project report and documentation.
   
This project provides a system to orchestrate complex processes or workflows, such as IT process automation, business process management.
